# Internal subdirectories that must be created prior to running the workflow

# File format:
# - ^relative/path/to/dir$
# - One line per directory
# - Paths relative to working directory (ie, the dir containing conf/ doc/
# scripts/ etc)

# Examples:
# bin
# data/ext_data/GEOquery
# ./temp

# Defaults for a new project/subproject:
./data
./data/ext
./data/int
./data/job
./doc/figure
./envs
./lib/built_packages
./lib/copied_packages
./lib/cloned_packages
./lib/global_rfuncs
./lib/global_rfuncs/R
./lib/global_rfuncs/tests
./lib/global_rfuncs/tests/testthat
./lib/local_rfuncs
./lib/local_rfuncs/R

# No ./conf should preexist in the rnaseq_workflow subjob: this is made as  a
# link. The user should specify job-specific values using
# <main_job>/conf/rnaseq_workflow/<specific config files>

# Data directories required by this workflow are specified as subdirs of
# <rnaseq_workflow>/data/job/; where the latter is a link to the main-project's
# directory: <main_project>/data/job/rnaseq_workflow/

./data/job/align
./data/job/diffex
./data/job/prefilter
