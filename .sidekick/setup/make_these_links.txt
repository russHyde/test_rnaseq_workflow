# Links that must be made before running the current job
# File format:
# - ^# This is a comment$
# - <BLANK LINES ARE DROPPED>
# - ^path/to/target/file ./local/path/to/linkname$
# - ~/tildes/are/valid
# - one line per link
#
# Relative paths for the targets should be written WRT the working directory
# for the current project (not WRT the subdirectory in which the link will be
# stored or the subdirectory in which make_these_links.txt is stored) ie,
# "../../some.target ./subdir/some.link" results in the link
# "./subdir/some.link -> ../../../some.target" when viewed with "ls -l"

# Example:
# ~/ext_data/GEOquery ./data/ext/GEOquery
# ../../some.target ./subdir/some.link

# Configs for the rnaseq_workflow subjob should be obtained from
#   <main_job>/conf/rnaseq_workflow
../../conf/rnaseq_workflow   ./conf

# Raw data should be in fastq folder
# - .../fastq/<sample_id>/<run_id><some_suffix>.fastq.gz
../../data/int/fastq   ./data/int/fastq

# A job-specific data folder is required for the workflow
../../data/job/rnaseq_workflow   ./data/job

# External genomic-references should be in ext/genomes
../../data/ext/genomes   ./data/ext/genomes
